    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <p>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love,
     while it was known to the Teutons as Frig after the wife of their god and religion.
     The size of Venus is about the size of the planet Earth, and Venus is moving away. At its closest state is 42 million km from Earth, 
     and its atmosphere is characterized by being thick and composed of carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure on the planet’s surface is equivalent to about 90 times the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth, and here are some of the characteristics of Venus:
     The average distance between a planet Venus and the sun: 108,200,000 km, equivalent to 0.723 astronomical units, meaning that the average distance between Venus and the sun is 0.732 times the distance between the sun and the earth.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The diameter of Venus: 12,102 km, equivalent to 0.95 times the diameter of planet Earth. </li>
        <li>Length of a year on Venus: 225 days.  </li>
        <li>Planet rotation time: 243 days counterclockwise. </li>
        <li>The average speed of rotation of the planet around the sun: 35 km / s. Temperature: 475 ° C. </li>
        <li>The tilt of the planet off its axis of rotation: 177.3 °. </li>
        <li>Planet density: 0.9 times that of planet Earth.  </li>
        <li>Planet Mass: About 0.81 times the mass of planet Earth. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <p>
     Mars is the fourth closest planet to the sun, and despite its small size, 
    it has captured the imagination and scientific interests of humans for centuries, and although it is not the closest planet to Earth, it is very similar to Earth. The planet has undergone some of the processes associated with the formation of the planets of Mercury, Earth and Venus, such as volcanoes, erosion and other effects of the atmosphere, in addition to that, it is similar to Earth in the growth and retraction of the icy poles cover with the change of seasons during the planet's rotation around the sun. Mars: 
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>
        The average distance between Mars and the sun: 228,000,000 km, which is equivalent to 1,524 astronomical units, meaning that the average distance between Mars and the sun is equivalent to 1.52 times the distance between the sun and the earth. The diameter of Mars: 6,792 km, which is equivalent to 0.532 times the diameter of Earth.
       </li>
       <li>The diameter of Mars: 6,792 km, which is equivalent to 0.532 times the diameter of Earth.</li>
       <li>The length of the year on Mars: 687 days. </li>
       <li>Planet rotation time: 24 hours and 37 minutes.  </li>
       <li>Tilt of the planet off its axis of rotation: 25.2 °.  </li>
       <li>Average planet velocity around the Sun: 24.14 km / s.  </li>
       <li>The average density of Mars: 3.95 g / cm3, equivalent to 0.7 times the density of Earth.  </li>
       <li>Planet mass: 0.108 times the mass of the Earth. </li>
       <li>The number of its moons: Qumran. </li>
    </ul>
